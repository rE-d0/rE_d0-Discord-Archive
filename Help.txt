So you need help with this, huh? well i got some Q&A's right here for you!

Q1 Is this illegal?
A1 No, the most these can do is get you banned off of a discord server.

Q2: So, what is this?
A2: Go to the Introduction.txt in the same folder.

Q3: These Crashers dont work.
A3: Discord patches up these crashers and fixes them occasianally. But i do add crashers to the folder
    every once in a while

Q4: Why did you do this! This is bad for discord!
A4: First of all, stop being such a karen. 2nd, check out Introduction.txt and Legal_Shit.txt 

Q5: How do these videos crash discord?
A5: Usually, when you play a "crasher" it is a video that is designed to crash you or someone else's 
    discord client. when making a crasher, certain hex/RGB color values are edited into the video
    in order for your monitor/pc to not be able to compute the certain pixel(s) that are edited with
    this value. Then, discord crashes due to those pixel(s) not being computable. here is an example.
    
   RGB;(256,256,256) <- Those pixels dont exist, but with some coding you can make that pixel into a video
                        that your computer cannot see, crashing discord.
